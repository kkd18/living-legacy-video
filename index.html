              You may be thinking "why would I want to share my story?" and that
              is an excellent question! Deciding what you leave behind in the
              world after you are gone is a big decision! But that is why we are
              here to help. Recording your stories and memories allows your
              family to remember you for years to come. No one wants to leave
              their loved ones behind hoping that they will remember how much
              you love them, so why not just tell them yourself! By leaving a
              legacy behind, you are allowing your family the option to never
              forget your voice and for some, this is everything. Speaking from
              experience, I would love to still be able to listen to my mothers
              many stories and to hear her say I love you again.

              I also wish I could gift my daughters with the many memories of
              their grandmother. That is the whole reason I created Living
              Legacy Video. I want you to be able to give your family a gift for
              generations to come. This may seem like a big decision. Our
              mission is to genuinely help you leave your loved ones with your
              story. Everyone's story is unique. With the help of us, you can
              choose from services such as one story for all, multiple dvd's,
              and adding pictures and music. We'll walk with you step by step to
              make the process easy and the end result a masterpiece. So why
              wouldn't you want to leave your legacy? There really isn't a good
              reason which is why we are the perfect company to aid
            </p>

              you in this process. If you are here, you have a choice as to how
              you want to be remembered. Your video story can be a gift of love
              to share for generations to come. Whether you believe it or not,
              someone you love will cherish your story after you're gone. All I
              have left are pictures and memories that have faded over time of
              the family I long to hear and see again. But you can ensure that
              none of your family will feel this way. It is important for us to
              preserve our life story for those we love and have not met yet.
