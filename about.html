            I’m Denise O’Leary and I want to help you preserve your special
            story.I created Living Legacy after the loss of several loved ones
            whos memories began to fade with time. Living Legacy provides you
            the opportunity to leave your memories for generations to come. As
            wonderful as they are, photos, portraits, and even home videos are
            an incomplete legacy. How wonderful would it be to capture a fuller
            picture of your life, your interests, and your uniqueness? So why
            not create “a living legacy” about you? I would give anything to
            hear my mom’s voice, see my mom’s smile, and feel her presence
            again. It’s amazing what we can convey through a video. My girls
            would also have a glimpse of their grandma.
